```
pip install -r ./S2R_transformer/requirement.txt
```



Training
----------

```python
python ./S2R_transformer/main_train_psnr.py --opt options/S2R/train_swinir_sr_lightweight.json
```

- Kill distributed training processes of `main_train_psnr.py`

```python
kill $(ps aux | grep main_train_gan.py | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
```

Getting Kernel
----------
```python
python ./KernelGAN/train.py --input-dir <LR data>
```

Transfer Learning
----------
the folder Set5 is the new dataset which is generated by four different blur kernels
```python
python ./transfer-learning/my_test_kernel.py --inputpath <LR data> --gtpath <HR data> --kernelpath <the kernel estimated by KernelGAN>
```
